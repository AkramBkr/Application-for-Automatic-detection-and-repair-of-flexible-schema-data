# Data Quality Control for Flexible Document-Oriented Data
This project focuses on enhancing data quality management for flexible, document-oriented data formats, particularly JSON documents and MongoDB NoSQL databases. The primary goal is to tackle prevalent data quality issues such as duplication and incompleteness in unstructured or semi-structured data.

# Method Overview
The proposed method includes three key functionalities:

Detection: Identifying common data quality problems.
Repair: Applying corrective actions to address these issues.
Verification: Ensuring the integrity and quality of the repaired data.
Implementation and Results
The method was validated through a custom tool developed specifically for handling flexible data structures. Tests with JSON and MongoDB data yielded promising results, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in maintaining data quality.
